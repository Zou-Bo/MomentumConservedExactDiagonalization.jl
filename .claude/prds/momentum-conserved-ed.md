# PRD: MomentumConservedExactDiagonalization Julia Package

## Executive Summary

This Julia package provides a comprehensive framework for exact diagonalization of quantum many-body systems with momentum conservation, targeting researchers in condensed matter physics. The package transforms existing research code into a production-ready Julia package with advanced features including entanglement entropy calculations, twisted boundary conditions, many-body Chern numbers, and spectrum flow analysis.

## Problem Statement

Current exact diagonalization implementations for momentum-conserved quantum systems are fragmented, difficult to reproduce, and lack standardized interfaces. Researchers typically maintain custom scripts that are hard to share, validate, or extend. There's a critical need for a unified, well-tested Julia package that provides both core ED capabilities and advanced analysis tools while maintaining momentum conservation symmetries.
