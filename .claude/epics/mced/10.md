# Task: Documentation & Release - Complete Package Documentation and Registration

## Objective
Prepare the momentum-conserved-exact-diagonalization package for public release with comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and Julia package registration.

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Complete API documentation with docstrings for all exported functions
- [ ] Comprehensive user guide with step-by-step tutorials
- [ ] Advanced usage examples for each major feature
- [ ] Performance tuning guide and best practices
- [ ] Migration guide from existing exact diagonalization packages
- [ ] Theoretical background documentation for key algorithms

## Tutorial Series
- [ ] Getting Started: Basic 1D Heisenberg chain diagonalization
- [ ] Momentum Conservation: Speedup demonstration and physics
- [ ] 2D Lattice Systems: Square lattice Hubbard model
- [ ] Topological Systems: Chern insulator calculation
- [ ] Fractional Quantum Hall Effect: Complete workflow
- [ ] Advanced Features: Custom symmetries and observables
- [ ] Performance Optimization: Memory and speed tuning

## Package Registration
- [ ] Create Project.toml with proper dependencies and compatibility bounds
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite (90%+ code coverage)
- [ ] Set up continuous integration (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Add benchmarking suite with performance regression tests
- [ ] Create documentation website with Documenter.jl
- [ ] Write README.md with quickstart and examples
- [ ] Add CITATION.bib for academic use
- [ ] Prepare registration request for Julia General registry

## Technical Documentation
- [ ] Architecture overview and design decisions
- [ ] Extending the package: Adding custom symmetries
- [ ] Performance characteristics and scaling analysis
- [ ] Comparison with other ED packages (ITensors, TenPy, etc.)
- [ ] Memory usage optimization strategies
- [ ] Parallel computing capabilities and limitations

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covering all major features
- [ ] Edge case testing for small systems (N=2,3,4)
- [ ] Large system testing (Nâ‰¥10) for performance validation
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Julia version compatibility testing (1.8, 1.9, 1.10+)
- [ ] Documentation accuracy verification through doctests

## Release Checklist
- [ ] Package version tagged (v1.0.0)
- [ ] All tests passing on CI
- [ ] Documentation deployed and accessible
- [ ] Benchmark results published
- [ ] Community feedback incorporated (beta testing)
- [ ] JuliaHub listing prepared
- [ ] Announcement post drafted for Julia Discourse
- [ ] Academic publication submitted (optional)

## Dependencies
- All previous tasks (mced-001 to mced-009) must be completed and tested
- Package dependencies must be stable and registered
- Documentation infrastructure must be in place

## Estimated Effort: 5-7 days

## Success Metrics
- Package successfully registered in Julia General registry
- Documentation website live with all tutorials
- Test suite passing with >90% coverage
- Positive feedback from beta testers
- Performance benchmarks competitive with existing packages
