# Task: Topological Invariants - Many-Body Chern Numbers via Berry Curvature

## Objective
Implement calculation of many-body topological invariants, specifically the Chern number, using Berry curvature integration over twisted boundary conditions parameter space.

## Requirements
- [ ] Implement many-body Berry curvature calculation
- [ ] Compute Chern numbers from Berry curvature integration
- [ ] Support both ground state and excited state Chern numbers
- [ ] Handle degenerate subspaces using non-Abelian Berry connection
- [ ] Implement efficient numerical differentiation for Berry curvature
- [ ] Add gauge-invariant parallel transport algorithms
- [ ] Support fractional Chern insulator states

## Technical Details
- Use twisted boundary conditions parameter space (θx, θy) as effective Brillouin zone
- Implement discrete Berry curvature: F = ∂θx A_y - ∂θy A_x where A_i = ⟨ψ|∂θi|ψ⟩
- Handle numerical stability via gauge-fixing and parallel transport
- Implement efficient Wilson loop calculations for Chern number quantization
- Support both individual eigenstate Chern numbers and total Chern number

## Mathematical Framework
- Many-body Chern number: C = (1/2π) ∫ dθx dθy F(θx, θy)
- Use discretized parameter space with adaptive mesh refinement
- Implement gauge-invariant discrete formula to avoid phase discontinuities
- Handle topological phase transitions via Chern number jumps

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Chern numbers quantized to integers for gapped phases
- [ ] Reproduce known results for integer quantum Hall states
- [ ] Correct fractional Chern numbers for fractional quantum Hall states
- [ ] Smooth Berry curvature fields without gauge discontinuities
- [ ] Benchmark against exact diagonalization results from literature
- [ ] Performance scales efficiently with system size

## Dependencies
- momentum-conserved-ed-007 (Twisted Boundary Conditions)
- momentum-conserved-ed-005 (Many-Body Physics Framework)
- momentum-conserved-ed-006 (Advanced Observables)
