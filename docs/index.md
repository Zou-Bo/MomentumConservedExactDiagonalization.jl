# MomentumConservedExactDiagonalization.jl

A Julia package for momentum-conserved exact diagonalization of quantum many-body systems.

## Overview

This package provides a comprehensive framework for exact diagonalization of quantum many-body systems with momentum conservation, targeting researchers in condensed matter physics. The package transforms existing research code into a production-ready Julia package with advanced features including entanglement entropy calculations, twisted boundary conditions, many-body Chern numbers, and spectrum flow analysis.

## Features

- **Momentum-conserved exact diagonalization** with automatic block diagonalization by momentum sectors
- **Advanced analysis tools** including entanglement entropy calculations, twisted boundary conditions, and many-body Chern numbers
- **High-performance implementation** leveraging Julia's sparse matrix capabilities and parallel computation
- **Comprehensive examples** for fractional quantum Hall effect, Chern insulators, and other quantum many-body systems

## Installation

Once the package is registered, you can install it using:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("MomentumConservedExactDiagonalization")
```

## Quick Start

```julia
using MomentumConservedExactDiagonalization

# Basic usage will be documented as features are implemented
```
